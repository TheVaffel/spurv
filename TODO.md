# TODO

Somewhat in order of priority

### Datatype Features
- [x] Structs
- [ ] Texture2D
- [ ] Functions for (re)composing vectors and matrices

### Structural Features
- [ ] Conditionals
- [ ] Functions

### BIG features (probably)
- [x] Uniforms
- [ ] Computation kernel support
- [ ] Geometry shader support

### Operations
- [x] Arithmetics
- [x] Basic vector and matrix operations
- [ ] Int `mod` and `rem`
- [ ] Floating point `mod` and `rem`

### Minor Refactorizations
- [ ] Simplify datatype names
- [ ] Simplify exposed user functions
- [ ] Make shortcuts for types of value nodes
