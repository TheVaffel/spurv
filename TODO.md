# TODO

Somewhat in order of priority

### Datatype Features
- [x] Structs
- [x] 2D Texture
- [x] Functions for composing vectors and matrices
- [x] (At least ish) Functions for reordering vector components

### Structural Features
- [x] Conditionals
- [ ] Functions

### BIG features (probably)
- [x] Uniforms
- [ ] Computation kernel support
- [ ] Geometry shader support

### Operations
- [x] Arithmetics
- [x] Basic vector and matrix operations
- [ ] Int `mod` and `rem`
- [ ] Floating point `mod` and `rem`
- [ ] Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication and the like for all combinations of matrices and scalars

### "Minor" Refactorizations
- [x] Simplify datatype names
- [x] Simplify exposed user functions
- [x] Make shortcuts for types of value nodes
- [ ] Make conversion system that allows for simpler interaction where user can provide primitive datatypes (or matrices from FlatAlg) in place for Spurv value
